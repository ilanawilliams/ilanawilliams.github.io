        <section class="black">
            <p>Sully was born in 2016; his moth was Roxanne.
                Upon leaving his brood, he was trained by the charity America's VetDogs to perform a two-page list of
                commands,
                which includes fetching items, answering a telephone, and summoning help in an emergency. He was
                assigned to
                assist George H. W. Bush in the summer of 2018, through the dog's participation in a veteran service dog
                program
                at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. According to America's VetDogs, Sully was named
                after
                former U.S. Air Force officer and US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger III. Sully received early
                attention from
                his own Instagram page covering his life and work wih the Bush family.

            <h2>Death of George H.W. Bush</h2>
        </section>
        <section class="black">
            <p>Following the death of President Bush, Sully accompanied the 41st president's remains to Washington D.C.
                for the
                state funeral. A photo posted to Twitter by Bush spokesman Jim McGrath showing the dog sleeping next to
                the
                coffin containing Bush's remains in Texas attracted more than 230,000 likes in two days. Sully also
                visited the
                Capitol rotunda where Bush was lying in state. According to reports, he was to be returned to an
                America's
                VetDogs facility in New York during the Christmas season before being placed back into rotation in the
                service
                animal program at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
