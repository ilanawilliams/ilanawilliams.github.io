            <p>A dragon is a snake-like legendary creature that appears in folklore of many cultures around the world.
                Beliefs
                about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle
                Ages
                have
                often been depicited as winged, horned, four-liegged and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern
                culutures
                are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.</p>
