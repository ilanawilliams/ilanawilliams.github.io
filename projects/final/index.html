            <p>Wearing neon orange vests and crouching behind tall grasses and trees, City Arborist Dawn Taft and a crew
                of
                volunteers tend trees and tackle invasive species at Driskell Park.
            </p>
            <p>Every third Saturday of each month, they
                focus on saving trees and tending native habitats, with a particular eye to those invasives, according
                to
                Taft.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                “When we just remove without replanting … the area that we’ve cleared, it allows other invasives to come
                in,” Taft said.</p>
            <p>Taft said that porcelain berry and wineberry are persistent in the park. Depending on the season, the
                crew
                may also take on bush honeysuckle, English ivy and garlic mustard.
            </p>
            <p>In Hyattsville, garlic mustard and English Ivy are popular invasive species.</p>

            <p>Garlic mustard has a “two-year life cycle and one plant can produce more than 7,000 seeds,” the brochure
                of
                the <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/mdinvasivebrochure-1.pdf"
                    target="_blank">terrestrial invasive plants of the Potomac Watershed</a> said. “The plants smother
                spring wildflowers and produce
                toxins to prevent the growth of native plants.”</p>
            <p>English Ivy is an “evergreen vine that can kill large trees or weigh them down to the point of collapse,”
                the
                brochure said. </p>
            <p>Bamboo, which proliferates quickly, is a problem especially on the east side of the park, Taft said.
                Bamboo
                most likely spread to the park from a nearby home.</p>
            <p>“My fear is that’s how it came to get in the woods,” Taft said. </p>
            <p>The National Park Service in the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife Service created <a
                    href="https://www.invasive.org/alien/pubs/midatlantic/midatlantic.pdf" target="_blank">an updated
                    version
                    of a
                    control guide </a>for invasive species in the mid-Atlantic region.</p>
            <p>Native species occur in a region without human intervention, the control guide said.</p>
            <p>Invasive species are likely to “cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health,” the guide
                said. </p>
            <p>Invasive species in the mid-Atlantic region include garlic mustard, Japanese stiltgrass, Japanese
                barberry,
                Japanese honeysuckle, English ivy, wineberry, Oriental Bittersweet, and multiflora rose.</p>
            <p>In Hyattsville, Taft said the group mostly maintains the trees at Driskell Park but has also removed
                English
                Ivy from University Hills and Japanese Knotweed at 38th Avenue Neighborhood Park. Later this month, they
                also worked at Melrose Park.
            </p>
            <p>Prince George’s County in Maryland created a <a
                    href="https://pgccouncil.us/DocumentCenter/View/6625/Community-Meeting-3_Blueprints"
                    target="_blank">draft of a climate
                    action plan. </a>One of the recommendations includes increasing tree canopy.</p>
            <p>“The county should develop tree stewardship programs that enable residents to plant and maintain trees
                where
                they are most needed,” the plan said.
            </p>
            <p>While the county develops programs, Taft’s volunteers learn skills that help them maintain their own
                property.
            </p>
            <p>“I had a lot of invasive plants in my backyard when I moved into Hyattsville,” said resident Brendan
                McCormick. “[I] figured I could learn how to get rid of them and help out.”

            <p>McCormick said he pulled English ivy from his yard, but it’s already starting to pop back up.</p>
            <p>During the group’s February removal clean-up, Taft noted a vine growing up a tree and demonstrated how to
                cut
                the invasive root at its base. She used a saw to cut a chunk of the root.
            </p>
            <p>“English ivy on the ground is not so bad if you keep it off the trees,” Taft said. “That same ivy,
                growing up
                a tree, can damage bark, leaving the tree vulnerable to disease.” </p>
            <p>Hyattsville lost 236 acres of tree canopy from 2009 to 2018, according to a <a

            <p>Taft has been coaching Hyattsville resident Marino Nunez on the skill of removing invasives. Nunez
                started
                training in 2019 and is now learning how to lead a crew himself.</p>
            <p>“I wish in my neighborhood we have people come to do this,” he said.</p>
            <p>Nunez, who volunteered at the park before the pandemic hit, noted the February gathering marked his first
                time back since 2019.</p>
            <p>“COVID[-19] destroyed us,” Taft said. “We couldn’t meet at all.”</p>
            <p>In 2019, volunteers cleared porcelain berry and bush honeysuckle from the northwest side of the park’s
                trail.
                When the volunteers returned to the park in 2021, they discovered porcelain berry completely covering
                the
                area they had cleared.</p>
            <p>“I don’t think anything [we planted] survived,” Taft said. “It was just these big mounds. They look like
                little igloos of porcelain berry where it had grown over our fencing.”</p>
            <p>February’s meet-up brought out the largest group of volunteers Taft had ever worked with. Taft plans to
                advertise her efforts in hopes that even more people will come.</p>
            <p>“Keeping it beautiful, having a space where we can enjoy and relax [and] have community is important,”
                Taft
                said.</p>
